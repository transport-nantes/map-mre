This is a simple django app that demonstrates my using leaflet (or
folium or branca) incorrectly.  I want the map page to generate html
for a map that I insert on the page.  Instead, it generates an entire
html document, which leads to broken html on the map page.  For
example, there are two "!<DOCTYPE html>" strings.
